# SQL Technical Interviews

This resource is crafted to aid anyone in refining their SQL expertise, specifically designed for those preparing for technical interviews. I've organized the content by categorizing topics drawn from prominent problem-solving websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and others.

## Topics

You should have the following prerequisites (SELECT, ORDER BY, WHERE, GROUP BY, Regex, CASE WHEN, IF, WHILE, JOINs)

### SELECTing

Here you'll learn how to use `SELECT` Statements with `ORDER BY` and `WHERE` etc
