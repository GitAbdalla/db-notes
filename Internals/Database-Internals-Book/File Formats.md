# File Formats

## Introduction

File formats play a crucial role in database systems, determining how data is organized, stored, and accessed on disk. Understanding various file formats is essential for database designers and administrators as it directly impacts system performance, storage efficiency, and data retrieval speed.

In this chapter, we'll explore different file formats commonly used in database systems, including:

1. Fixed-length records
2. Variable-length records
3. Slotted pages
4. Log-structured file formats

We'll discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each format, their implementation details, and their suitability for different types of database workloads. Additionally, we'll examine how these file formats interact with other database components such as indexing structures and buffer management systems.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of database file formats and be able to make informed decisions when designing or optimizing database storage systems.
