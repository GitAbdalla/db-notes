# 1. B-tree Basics

## Introduction

B-trees are fundamental data structures in database systems, playing a crucial role in efficient data storage and retrieval. They are self-balancing tree structures that maintain sorted data and allow for logarithmic time complexity in search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Key characteristics of B-trees include:

1. Balanced structure: All leaf nodes are at the same depth, ensuring consistent performance.
2. Multiple keys per node: Each node can contain more than one key, reducing tree height.
3. Variable number of children: Nodes can have a variable number of child nodes within a predefined range.
4. Efficient for disk-based systems: B-trees minimize disk I/O operations, making them ideal for database storage engines.

In this section, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of B-trees, their properties, and how they are implemented in database systems. We'll also discuss variations like B+ trees and their specific advantages in database applications.

Understanding B-trees is essential for grasping the inner workings of many database systems and their indexing mechanisms, which directly impact query performance and overall system efficiency.
