# DB Internals

Welcome to the DB Internals section! This area focuses on the inner workings and fundamental concepts of database systems. Understanding database internals is crucial for optimizing performance, troubleshooting issues, and making informed design decisions in database-driven applications.

Understanding how databases work under the hood is crucial for optimizing performance, troubleshooting issues, and making informed design decisions. We'll explore various aspects of database architecture, storage mechanisms, and data organization strategies.

Key topics we'll cover include:
1. The structure of database management systems
2. How data is stored and retrieved
3. Memory management in databases
4. Query processing and optimization
5. Transaction management
6. Concurrency control mechanisms
